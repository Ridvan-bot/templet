## Overview
This repository serves as a template for quickly duplicating workflows and configurations into other projects. The goal is to streamline your development process by providing a pre-configured set of tools, workflows, and settings that can be copied into new repositories.

## Features
Pre-configured GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines.
Automated Semantic Release for versioning and changelog generation.
TypeScript support and type definitions for Node.js.
Ready-to-use configuration for managing conventional commits.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
To create a new project using this template, clone the repository and rename it to fit your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ridvan-bot/templet.git your-new-project
cd your-new-project
```

2. **Update Project Details**:
Edit the package.json file to include your projectâ€™s specific information:

Update the name, version, description, author, and repository fields.
Adjust dependencies as needed for your new project.

3. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all necessary packages installed:

```

4. **GitHub Actions**:
This template includes pre-configured workflows for GitHub Actions. To use them:

Copy the .github/workflows directory to your new repository.
Adjust the workflow files if necessary to match your project structure.

5. **Semantic Release Configuration**:
The template is set up with Semantic Release to automate the release process:

Automatic versioning based on commit messages.
Generates a CHANGELOG.md file.
Publishes releases to GitHub and updates the package on npm.
Make sure your new repository has the required environment variables set up:

GITHUB_TOKEN (for GitHub releases).
NPM_TOKEN (if publishing to npm).

## Dependencies
The project includes the following dependencies:

TypeScript for type safety (typescript, @types/node).
Semantic Release plugins:
@semantic-release/changelog: Generates a changelog.
@semantic-release/git: Commits version changes back to your repository.
@semantic-release/github: Publishes releases to GitHub.
@semantic-release/npm: Handles npm publishing.
Scripts
